A charming, minimalist 2D platformer where players control a chicken character using only their voice. The goal is to navigate through various obstacle courses across multiple levels, relying on vocal input for movement and jumps.Core Mechanics:Voice Control (Primary):Low Volume/Whispering/Humming: Chicken walks slowly to the right.Medium Volume/Talking: Chicken walks at a normal pace to the right.High Volume/Shouting/Screaming/Sudden Loud Noises: Chicken performs a jump. The duration and intensity of the sound should influence the height and length of the jump (e.g., a short yell for a small hop, a sustained scream for a high, long jump).Consideration: Implement a small dead zone for voice input to prevent accidental movement when no sound is intended.Movement:The chicken constantly moves forward (to the right) at a base speed determined by low/medium voice input.Voice input primarily controls jumps.Falling off platforms or hitting obstacles results in a game over or respawn at the last checkpoint.Art Style:2D Pixel Art / Cartoonish Flat Design: Choose a clear, appealing 2D style. Pixel art can give it a retro feel, while a clean cartoon style can enhance its charm.Character Design: A cute, expressive chicken sprite with different animations for walking, jumping, falling, and potentially a "flapping" animation during jumps.Environment: Simple, distinct backgrounds and foreground elements for each level. Obstacles should be clearly defined and easily recognizable.Level Design (2-3 Levels with Varying Intensity):General: Each level should be an endless runner or have a clear start and end point. Incorporate checkpoints strategically.Level 1: The Coop Run (Easy/Tutorial)Theme: Farmyard, grassy plains.Obstacles: Simple gaps to jump over, low fences, small hay bales, very basic moving platforms.Intensity: Focus on teaching the player the voice control mechanics. Jumps should be forgiving.Level 2: The Forest Folly (Medium)Theme: Dense forest, winding paths.Obstacles: Wider gaps, higher ledges, falling branches, spike pits, more complex moving platforms (up/down, back/forth).Intensity: Requires more precise vocal control for varied jump heights and timings.Level 3: The Mountain Mayhem (Hard)Theme: Rocky mountains, icy peaks, stormy skies.Obstacles: Very wide chasms, rapidly moving platforms, crumbling ledges, icicles dropping, wind gusts affecting jumps.Intensity: Demands expert vocal modulation and quick reflexes. Punishing mistakes more severely.User Interface (UI):Start Screen: "Play," "Options," "How to Play" (brief tutorial text).In-Game UI:Voice Input Visualizer: A simple, real-time visual indicator (e.g., a sound wave, a bar that fills) to show the player's current voice input level. This is crucial for feedback.Score/Distance Counter: How far the chicken has traveled.Pause Button: With "Resume," "Restart Level," "Main Menu" options.Game Over Screen: "Try Again," "Back to Main Menu."Sound Design:Background Music: Light, upbeat, and progressively more intense/dramatic per level.Sound Effects:Chicken clucks/squawks for various actions (walking, jumping, landing).Impact sounds for hitting obstacles.Game over sound.Positive sounds for collecting power-ups (if any).Checkpoints reached.Technical Considerations:Platform: (Web Browser)Voice Recognition API/Library: Research and integrate a reliable library for real-time sound amplitude detection. (e.g., Unity's built-in Microphone class, Web Audio API for browser games, platform-specific APIs for mobile).Performance: Optimize for smooth gameplay even with continuous voice input processing.1. Voice Calibration: Handling Different Players' Voice RangesSolution: Initial Calibration PhaseThe most effective way is to implement a short, mandatory calibration phase at the beginning of the game, or ideally, the first time a player launches it.How it works:Instruction: On a dedicated "Voice Calibration" screen, instruct the player to speak/make noises at their "normal" walking volume and then their "screaming" jump volume.Guided Prompts:"Please make a soft, consistent sound (like a whisper or hum) for 3-5 seconds to set your walking volume baseline." (The game records the average decibel level.)"Now, make your loudest possible sound (like a yell or scream) for 1-2 seconds to set your jump threshold." (The game records the peak decibel level.)Visual Feedback: Provide a real-time sound meter/bar during calibration so players can see their input.Save Settings: Save these calibrated thresholds (e.g., min_walk_decibel, max_jump_decibel) to player preferences.Optional: "Reset Calibration" in Options: Allow players to re-calibrate their voice at any time from the settings menu.Environmental Noise: Calibration Phase or Adaptive Noise Floor?Both have merits, but for a game like this, a calibration phase with an adaptive noise floor during gameplay is the best combination.Calibration Phase (as above): This is where you establish the player's intended minimum "quiet" sound.Adaptive Noise Floor Detection (during gameplay):Concept: The game continuously monitors the lowest decibel level detected over a very short period (e.g., the last 1-2 seconds) when no intentional player input is being made. This "lowest level" becomes the temporary noise floor.How it handles noise: If a sudden, sustained background noise (like a TV or fan) starts, the system gradually adjusts its perceived "quiet" to filter out this new constant sound.Threshold Adjustment: When a player makes a sound, the game measures it against this adaptive noise floor, not just a static one.Grace Period: A short grace period (e.g., 0.1-0.2 seconds) can be added after a jump to ignore very short, unintended sounds.Visual Feedback: The voice input visualizer should reflect this noise filtering, showing only the player's active input above the current noise floor.Jump Mechanics Refinement: Sustained Loud Sounds
